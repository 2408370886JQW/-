# Fix Tasks

## Phase 1: Fix MeetPage Layout & Back Button
- [ ] **Back Button Logic**:
    - [ ] Step 1 (Scenario Selection): Clicking back should call `onNavigate('encounter')` to return to Home tab.
    - [ ] Step 2+ (Flow): Clicking back should return to previous step.
- [ ] **Layout Fixes**:
    - [ ] **Scenario Grid**: Adjust aspect ratio to prevent deformation (check `aspect-[4/3]`).
    - [ ] **Scan Card**: Ensure it's fixed at the bottom but doesn't overlap content improperly.
    - [ ] **Header**: Verify padding and alignment.
- [ ] **Visual Polish**:
    - [ ] Check "Bro" card selected state styling.
    - [ ] Verify font sizes and colors against screenshots.
