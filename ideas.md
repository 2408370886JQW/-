  **Design Movement**: Modern Minimalist with Soft Pop (现代简约 + 柔和波普)
  
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Clarity & Focus**: Content is king. Reduce visual noise to highlight social activities and merchant information.
  2. **Approachable Warmth**: Use soft shapes and warm tones to create a welcoming, non-intimidating social atmosphere.
  3. **Fluid Navigation**: Seamless transitions between map, list, and detail views to encourage exploration.
  4. **Contextual Relevance**: UI adapts to the user's intent (finding people vs. finding places).

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Primary**: Soft Coral (#FF6B6B) - Energetic but not aggressive, suitable for social actions.
  - **Secondary**: Warm Teal (#4ECDC4) - Balances the warmth, used for "places" and "calm" indicators.
  - **Background**: Off-white / Cream (#F7F9FC) - Reduces eye strain compared to stark white, adds a "paper-like" feel.
  - **Text**: Dark Slate (#2D3436) for readability, avoiding pure black.
  - **Reasoning**: This palette evokes a sense of "lifestyle" and "leisure," fitting for a social + service app. It's friendly, modern, and distinct from the cold blue of corporate apps.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Card-Based & Floating**: Content sits on floating cards with soft shadows, lifting them off the map or background.
  - **Bottom-Heavy Navigation**: Key interactive elements (search, main actions) are placed within thumb reach at the bottom.
  - **Asymmetric Headers**: Section titles and key info might align left with large typography, while actions float right or overlap.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **"Squircle" Everything**: Super-ellipses for buttons, cards, and avatars to feel organic.
  - **Glassmorphism Overlays**: Subtle blur effects on floating panels (like the map search bar) to maintain context of what's behind.
  - **Playful Micro-interactions**: Bouncy scale effects on tap, smooth morphing icons.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Swipe-Driven**: Swipe to switch between Map/List, swipe to dismiss cards.
  - **Direct Manipulation**: Drag the map to search, tap markers to expand details without leaving the context.

  **Animation**:
  - **Spring Physics**: All movements (modals opening, lists scrolling) use spring physics for a natural feel.
  - **Staggered Entry**: List items and markers pop in with a slight delay to guide the eye.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: "Outfit" or "Plus Jakarta Sans" (Geometric Sans) - Bold, friendly, modern.
  - **Body**: "Inter" or "Public Sans" - Clean, legible at small sizes.
  - **Hierarchy**: High contrast in size and weight. Large, bold titles paired with small, uppercase, tracked-out labels.

  **Design Movement**: Neo-Brutalism / Gen Z Bold (新粗野主义)
  
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Raw & Honest**: High contrast, bold outlines, unrefined shadows.
  2. **High Energy**: Vibrant, clashing colors to stimulate excitement and "FOMO".
  3. **Function First**: Big buttons, clear labels, no hiding behind subtle menus.
  
  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Primary**: Electric Blue (#2E5CFF) & Acid Green (#CCFF00).
  - **Background**: Stark White (#FFFFFF) or Light Grey (#F0F0F0).
  - **Strokes**: Thick Black (#000000) borders.
  - **Reasoning**: Targets a younger demographic looking for "cool" and "authentic" experiences. Stands out in a sea of clean, minimal apps.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Grid & Borders**: Visible grid lines, hard edges, distinct separation of content areas.
  - **Marquee Text**: Scrolling text for announcements or trending tags.
  
  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Hard Shadows**: No blur, just solid offset color blocks for depth.
  - **Monospace Fonts**: For data points (distance, time, price).
  - **Stickers & Emojis**: Used heavily as UI elements.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Snappy & Instant**: No slow fades. Toggle states are instant.
  - **Haptic Heavy**: Vibration feedback on every significant action.

  **Animation**:
  - **Linear & Fast**: Quick transitions, sliding panels with no bounce.
  - **Glitch Effects**: Subtle glitching on active states or loading.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: "Space Grotesk" or "Syne" - Quirky, distinctive.
  - **Body**: "JetBrains Mono" or "Roboto Mono" - Technical, raw.

  **Design Movement**: Ethereal Gradient / Aura (极光/弥散风格)
  
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Atmospheric**: Focus on mood and vibe.
  2. **Immersive**: Full-screen imagery, blended backgrounds.
  3. **Softness**: No hard lines, everything blends.
  
  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Palette**: Deep Purples, Pinks, and Cyans blended in gradients.
  - **Mode**: Dark mode default.
  - **Reasoning**: Creates a "nightlife" or "dreamy" aesthetic, perfect for evening social activities and discovering hidden gems.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Layered Depth**: Elements recede into the background.
  - **Centered Focus**: Key content often centered with radial gradients highlighting it.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Mesh Gradients**: Backgrounds that slowly shift.
  - **Glowing Borders**: Active elements glow rather than change color.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Flow**: Continuous scrolling, infinite lists.
  - **Hold to Preview**: Long press to peek at content.

  **Animation**:
  - **Slow & Smooth**: Long duration eases, dream-like transitions.
  - **Blur In/Out**: Content fades and blurs into existence.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: "Clash Display" - Elegant, high contrast.
  - **Body**: "Satoshi" - Clean, modern sans.
